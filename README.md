Fibaro Binding for Openhab

This binding integrates the Openhab (www.openhab.org), an open source software for home automation with Fibaro (www.fibaro.com), a z-wave gateway.

Allthoug there is already a z-wave binding for Openhab I have found Fibaro to be far more user friendly when it comes to managing your z-wave devices. On the other hand Fibaro is not open source. You can write lua scripts in Finaro but it is still very limited compared to the Openhab community in terms of what you can do and what other technologies you can integrate.

Since Fibaro has a good api the idea for this binding came up. The purpose of the binding is to offer the best of both worlds. Manage your z-wave devices thought the Fibaro but get a seamless integration that lets you control and interact with the z-wave devices from Openhab.

If you want to contribute there is plenty of good informaiton on how to deveop bindigs at:
